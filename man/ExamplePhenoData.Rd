\description{
ExamplePhenoData is a simulated vector of phenotype for 1000 individuals.
In this simulated example dataset, we have considered two tissues and corresponding
sets of 100 tissue-specific eQTLs each.
First half of 1000 individuals' phenotypes were simulated to have genetic effect from the first tissue
specific eQTLs, but no effect from the second tissue-specific eQTLs. Hence first 500 individuals
were assigned as the first tissue-specific genetic subtype. Similarly, second half of
the 1000 individuals were simulated to have genetic effect from the second-tissue specific eQTLs and hence
they are second tissue-specific genetic subtype.
