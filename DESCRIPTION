Description: If multiple tissue or cell-type specific biological pathways underlie a phenotype, it can be possible to identify the subtype of the phenotype which is defined by heterogeneous tissue or cell-type -specific genetic architecture of the trait. For example, an individual's body mass index (BMI) can be regulated more by the set of genes higher expressed in brain compared to the set of genes higher expressed in adipose, and vice versa. We propose a method eGST which learns about such subtype structure of a complex trait based on individual-level data of marginal phenotype and genotypes of sets of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) each corresponding to the set of genes higher expressed in a tissue. The method is based on a finite mixture model under Bayesian framework and implements the maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimation of subtype posterior probability across individuals and other model parameters.
